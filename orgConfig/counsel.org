* Ivy + Swiper + Counsel

Ivy is just an “Interactive completion interface” meaning it helps you type less and get the stuff you need faster. When you run an ivy command you can type to narrow down the results.

Swiper helps you search through emacs, and shows you text around the matching terms. It turns out Ivy is actually required for Swiper to work. If you install Swiper, Ivy gets installed as a dependency.

Counsel appears to provide additional functions for various ivy and swiper commands. Counsel is available via Melpa, and will automatically install both Swiper AND Ivy as dependencies.
